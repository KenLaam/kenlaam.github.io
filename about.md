Hi, I'm Ken Laam, a Senior iOS Developer with over 10 years of experience building apps for the Apple ecosystem.

I'm passionate about crafting elegant, user-focused experiences using Swift and SwiftUI. Whether it's diving deep into iOS frameworks or exploring the latest Apple technologies, I love pushing the boundaries of what's possible on Apple platforms.

Outside of my full-time work, I'm an indie developer building apps that solve real problems. You can check out my projects on the [Apps](/apps/) page.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate!
