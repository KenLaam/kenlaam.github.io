Hello! I'm Ken, an iOS developer.

I've created this blog to share my experiences building iOS apps. I'll be writing about:

- Swift and iOS development tips
- Lessons learned from shipping apps
- Tools and workflows that help me be productive

## Code Examples

Here's a simple Swift example:

```swift
func greet(name: String) -> String {
    return "Hello, \(name)!"
}

let message = greet(name: "World")
print(message) // Hello, World!
```

## What's Next

Stay tuned for more posts about iOS development. You can also check out my [apps](/apps) page to see what I've built.

Thanks for reading!
