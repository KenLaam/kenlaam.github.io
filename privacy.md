# Privacy Policy

Last updated: December 2024

## Overview

## Data Collection

My apps are designed with privacy in mind. I collect minimal data necessary for app functionality.

### Analytics

Some apps may use anonymized analytics to understand usage patterns and improve the app experience. This data:
- Cannot identify you personally
- Is not sold to third parties
- Is used solely for app improvement

### Third-Party Services

Some apps may integrate with third-party services. Please review their privacy policies:
- Apple App Store
- [Add others as needed]
